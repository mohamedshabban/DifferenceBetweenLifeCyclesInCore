# DifferenceBetweenLifeCyclesInCore
Understanding the life cycle of Dependency Injection (DI) is very important in ASP.Net Core applications. As we know, Dependency injection (DI) is a technique for achieving loose coupling between objects and their collaborators, or dependencies. Most often, classes will declare their dependencies via their constructor, allowing them to follow the Explicit Dependencies Principle. This approach is known as "constructor injection".
